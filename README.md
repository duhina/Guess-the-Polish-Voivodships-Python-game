This is a python quizz which presuming that there are 16 Voivodships in Poland and every single time you type in the name of a voivodship, then that voivodship gets labelled and you score one point.

In this game I  used turtle and some CSV data. 

There are 4 files: 
 * csv file - contains all 16 Voivodships of Poland by name and then X and Y value
 * gif
 * final_board file
 * and the main file.
